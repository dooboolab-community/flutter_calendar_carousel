## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.1] - 2026-09-15

- Keep a manual page drag from snapping back to the previous page when it is
  released near the halfway point ([#428](https://github.com/hyochan/flutter_calendar_carousel/issues/428)).
- Check in the analyzer exclusions that Flutter's `analysis_options.yaml`
  migration writes during `flutter pub get`, so release validation runs
  `flutter pub publish --dry-run` from a clean working tree.


## [3.0.0] - 2026-08-09

### Breaking changes

- Redesign the public API around controlled `selectedDate` and `focusedDate`
  values, `onDateSelected`, `onDateLongPressed`, and `onPageChanged` callbacks.
- Replace the 2.x boolean view selector with `CalendarCarousel.month`,
  `CalendarCarousel.week`, and the explicit `CalendarView` enum.
- Remove the package-owned event and marked-date models, adapter interfaces,
  mutable event index, positional day builder, and their deep-import files.
  Applications now provide their own model through `eventsForDate`.
- Group header, weekday, layout, paging, theme, day-style, and marker options
  into focused immutable configuration objects. Calendar size is now controlled
  exclusively by parent constraints, and pages always snap.
- Replace date lists and integer weekday indexes with `isDateEnabled`, Flutter
  `Locale`, and the `CalendarWeekday` enum. The default range now spans 100
  years before and after today.

### Added and changed

- Unify month and week navigation on a lazy, date-only pager that handles every
  first-day-of-week value, year boundaries, range updates, and runtime view
  changes consistently.
- Add named day, marker, date-style, header, and weekday builders with immutable
  details objects and Material-theme-aware defaults.
- Limit the built-in event marker to a configured number of visible dots plus
  one bounded overflow label; custom marker builders run once per marked day.
- Fix controlled selection updates, duplicate page-change callbacks, external
  focus navigation, date-picker lifecycle and locale fallback, and day
  semantics.
- Make rapid header navigation, vertical paging, far date-picker jumps, narrow
  and wide layouts, large text, RTL ordering, and event overflow badges
  deterministic and regression-tested.
- Preserve complete day grids under constrained heights and vertical page
  previews, keep hit targets at full-cell size, expose read-only dates as
  labels, and add customizable event-count semantics with selected-marker
  contrast.
- Keep week views complete when month-only outside-date filtering is enabled,
  and derive today, selection, weekend, and month flags from each cell's date.
- Replace date-dependent tests and the previous example with deterministic
  month/week regression coverage and a concise Material 3 demo.
- Refresh and commit the example lockfile during automated version bumps to prevent recurring release drift ([#409](https://github.com/hyochan/flutter_calendar_carousel/issues/409)).
- Provision pub.dev OIDC credentials in the publish workflow so tagged releases do not wait for interactive authentication ([#403](https://github.com/hyochan/flutter_calendar_carousel/issues/403)).
- Update the example to `intl` 0.20.3, current Android build tooling, iOS 13/UIScene, and Flutter Swift Package Manager integration.
- Add regression coverage for disabled-date predicates and page navigation, and
  build the Android example in CI.
- Synchronize Codex and Claude repository workflows around shared issue, verification, commit, rebase, self-review, and five-minute PR review procedures.
- Document the autonomous maintenance runbooks, PR review loop, and deployment workflow expectations ([#402](https://github.com/hyochan/flutter_calendar_carousel/pull/402)).
